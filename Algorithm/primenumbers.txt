Algorithm to check if number is prime or not.

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize divisor as 2.
Step 3: Input number that needs to checked from the user.
Step 4: Check if divisor is less than half of the number entered in Step 3. If yes, go to Step 5 else go to Step 7.
Step 5: Check if number is divisible by divisor. If yes, then go to step 7 else go to step 6.
Step 6: Increment value of divisor by 1, go to Step 4.
Step 7: Output Number is prime. Go to Step 9.
Step 8: Output Number is not prime. Go to Step 9.
Step 9: End
