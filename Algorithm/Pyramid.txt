Algorithm to print Pyramid Structure

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize i as 0.
Step 3: Initialize j as 1.
Step 4: Print value of j.
Step 5: Increment value of j by 1.
Step 6:Check if value of j is less than or equal to i. If yes, go to Step 4 else go to Step 7.
Step 7: Move to next line on the output screen. Increment value of i by 1.
Step 8:Check if value of i is less than or equal to 5. If yes, go to Step 3 else go to Step 9.
Step 9: End
